ALBUM alert! I will release an album on @CIA on Sept 14th!!! Pre-listen and pre-order now on BC (link in bio). An exclusive, limited edition cassette version will be available!

All tracks are based purely on #GravitationalWaves from LIGO/VIRGO/GEO600 detections. Using #livecoding, I create an immersive, experimental soundscape that will not only stretch and squeeze #spacetime but also your body.
