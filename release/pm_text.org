* PM album release
It took about 100 years for Einsteins prediction to become true, but in 2015 gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the [[https://advancedligo.mit.edu/][Advanced LIGO]] instrument. These waves coming from the depths of space, carry energy and information about the history of the univers. They squeeze and stretch the fabric of space-time even after billions of years of travelling.

On this album, sonifications of gravitational waves are transformed into musique concréte-inspired pieces of sonic art. The tracks help us to travel through space and time with rhythmic patterns, mysterious sound textures and experimental structures. /*Ji kū kan*/ explores space and time in a minimal yet sometimes dreamy as well as danceble way. A live-coded experimental journey.
