Hi.

It took about 100 years for Einsteins prediction to become true, but in 2015 gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the Advanced LIGO instrument. These waves coming from the depths of space, carry energy and information about the history of the universe and hit us on a daily basis. With my project "harte echtzeit" (https://github.com/harte-echtzeit), I use audio samples of detected gravitational waves and transform them into musique concréte-inspired pieces of sonic art. By utilizing techniques of live coding, I perform music with computer code which conveys the history of gravitational wave detection and the deep space. The music helps us to travel through space and time with rhythmic patterns, mysterious sound textures and experimental structures.
I'm looking for a label to publish a 30-minute album of this unique music mainly in a digital format with a limited edition of e.g. a cassette tape release. I would be happy if your label is interested to work with me. I choose your label based on artists such as HAŁVVA & Timothée Quost, exm and Cahn Ingold Prelog who recently released with you. Form my point of view I would be an interesting addition to your portfolio with not only unique source material, but also with novel structures and approaches to modify sounds and noises. I'm especially interested not only in publishing this particular album, but also in learning and growing as an artist by receiving guidance and expertise from you and your team. That would be great!

I'm aware that your time is surely limited, but I would be very happy if you could have a listen to the mixdown of my album which you can find following this link:

I would very much appreciate if you would respond to me even in the case that you are not able to work with me.

Many thanks and regards,
Christopher
