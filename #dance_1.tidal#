{- this is the draft of a dance piece for the GW EP based on some sketches
--> chrs/harte_echtzeit 2022-03-26
--> second iteration 2022-06-11
start with 1-3 -> later fade out 2 for fade in 4

--> next interation 2023-04-07
plan for the track:
-> kick of with 3 synth, vary a bit (e.g. sample number + jux rev) and bring in
-> 1 as the base beat for the whole track (loud and hard + variation; then quieter)
-> harsh break

for recording/live playing
- 3 is the main theme and starts of
- 4 is a supporting bass line which can be played from time to time (starts about 30secs into the track after 3)
- 1 kicks the whole track; shortly after 3 + culminates in loud break out
- 2 just short in break out noise before break
- after noise starts of with 4

 -- use the same beat as in ambient here more prominent
