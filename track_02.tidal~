notes on live playing:

- d1+d2 start in parallel to transform the loud/noisy ending of track 01
- d6 takes over as a rhythmic structure to transport enthusiastic work and quest for GW
- d6 gets transformed to be a bit more dirtier and
- d3(formaly exp02) kicks in to make an unpleasent/broken feeling
- fades out slowly and gets slower in playback
- ends with d2 (from exp02
