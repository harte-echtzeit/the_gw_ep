# the gravitational wave EP
This will possible become an EP with music made of gravitational wave samples (first LIGO/VIRGO detected events in 2015). Please find samples in the other repo.

This file will soon contain some information on the tracks and planned EP. All basic structure is given by the `.tidal` files (written in TidalCycles live coding language); only some editing done after the initial live recording.

## story
{to be told}
- connection of science and art
- new kind of sciences needs new kind of communication --> live coding as a possible way?


## tracks

01: {formally named `ambient` now `birth of melancholia`}
- a more or less dark and mysterious track on the formation of graviattional waves as a dance of the dead (black holes) and its travel through time
- minmal sound which transports darkness, power, depth, anxiety, sometimes quietness and restraint
- ends in brutality and shear force/energy

02/03: {named `experimental_1` and `experimental_2`}
- represent the long and twisted scientific discovery from Einsteins initial prediction to a centuary long, multi-national scientific/engineering project that needed many, many smart brains, ideas and hands to solve all hard problems along the way
- conveys dedication, complexity, problems, twisted paths, (possible) failure, hardship, long time scales
- tells a bit about the absurdity to chase something which is hard to grasp and nearly impossible to understand
- symbol of human curiosity and drive

04: {named `dance_1`}
- pleasure of success and cheerfullness 
- sweetness of discovery and relief
- intuition about the original predictions
- end of a long journey but ultimately just the beginning of a new part of science
- complete resolution and also transition
- as in music/arts/culture ->  not really important for survival of mankind, but at the same time extremly important in order to keep curiosity alive
